# Lab5
Introduction
In this lab, we had to create an application to populate a database from the provided Geo City Lite CSV file and allow the users to search for cities near a particular lat/long or another city. The application will start by loading the data from the csv file into the database, if it has not yet been loaded. Then the application allow the user to enter the total number of cities to search for and either lat/long or a city name. For lat/long simply apply the nearby search to locate cities near the lat/long from the DB. In case of city name, use reverse search in the db to find out the lat/long for that city, before applying the same nearby search algorithm. 

How to run

Open the project in Netbeans and it will work.

Analysis 

The main purpose of this lab was to have command over or improve our skills in Database Population, Data retrieval from a db, Smart searching and file handling.

Our task 

Our task was to implement the following 
1.	Creating and populating a database table from the Geo City CSV file.
2.	Developing an interface for user to search a city and find out its latitudes and longitudes.
3.	Developing an interface for user to find out the specified number of cities nearby a target city or lat/long.
4.	Creation of unit tests to evaluate your code.
5.	Using a Version Control System (VCS) to manage your solutions.
